# How we made the program
For the development of the project, we used an MVC architecture, which stands for Model, View, and Controller. This architectural pattern allow us to separate software components. The 'View' is responsible for storing the graphical interface, specifically for the login functionality in our case, where we used JavaFX. The 'Controller' is responsible for facilitating communication between the 'View' and the 'Model.' Lastly, the 'Model' represents the backend, and by analogy, it's where the encryption process occurs in our program.

It's important to highlight that we included the Singleton pattern, which is a software design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance. In the context of this specific project, it's crucial as it prevents multiple encryption processes.
